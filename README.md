# vbkeylogger
VB.Net code that allows you to log keys on a local machine, and the application in which they were pushed. Obviously if you wanted to get really sneaky, you could make it email you, but i'll leave that for you to figure out how to do.

Note: This is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for any wrong doing


# Implementation 
1. Either import the 'keyboard.vb' class, or create your own and copy and paste all the code. 
2. On the form you wish to use, create 1 textbox named 'TextBox1' and 2 timers named 'timerKeys' and 'timerSave'
3. Modify the form1.vb file according to your needs in order to suit the setup of your application

And that's it :-)
